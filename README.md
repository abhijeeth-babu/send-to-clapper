# Send to Clapper  

"Send to Clapper" is a browser extension designed to enhance your video-watching experience by opening YouTube videos and Shorts directly in the [Clapper](https://rafostar.github.io/clapper/) media player. With a single click, the extension pauses the video on YouTube and sends its link to Clapper, allowing you to enjoy smooth playback with Clapper's robust performance and feature set.  

Clapper is a modern and lightweight media player built on top of GStreamer. Itâ€™s designed to integrate seamlessly with the GNOME desktop environment, offering excellent support for flatpak apps and the latest media codecs.

## Installation

#### Chrome/Chromium

### 2. Install the Native Messaging Host  

The native messaging host enables communication between the browser extension and Clapper.  

#### What It Does  
The host script (`clapper_host.py`) receives links from the extension and launches Clapper with the given video URL. It uses a JSON manifest to inform the browser about its location and permissions.  

### Using `installer.py`  

The `installer.py` script sets up the native messaging host for your browser. Clone this repo and run the `installer.py`.  

#### General Usage  
```bash
python3 installer.py <browser>
```

Supported browsers: `firefox`, `chrome`, `chromium`.  

To display the JSON manifest without installation:  
```bash
python3 installer.py show <browser>
```

#### Installation for Firefox  
```bash
python3 installer.py firefox
```
This will:  
1. Copy the manifest file to `~/.mozilla/native-messaging-hosts/`.  
2. Update the manifest with the correct path to `clapper_host.py`.  

#### Installation for Chrome/Chromium  
```bash
python3 installer.py chrome
```
or  
```bash
python3 installer.py chromium
```
This will:  
1. Copy the manifest file to the appropriate location (`~/.config/google-chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/` or `~/.config/chromium/NativeMessagingHosts/`).  
2. **IMPORTANT:** After installation, manually edit the manifest file at the displayed location to replace `ID` in the `allowed_origins` field with your Chrome extension ID (found in `chrome://extensions/`).

## Tip  

Turn off video previews in the Playback and Performance section of YouTube settings.
